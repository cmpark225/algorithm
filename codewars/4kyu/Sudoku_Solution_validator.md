## Detail

Sudoku Background

Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Sudoku Solution Validator

Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.

The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains integers from 0 to 9.

Examples
```
validSolution([
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]
]); // => true
validSolution([
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2], 
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 0, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 0],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 0, 2, 0],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 0, 0, 4, 8, 1, 1, 7, 9]
]); // => false
```

## Best Practices
```
def validSolution(board):
    blocks = [[board[x+a][y+b] for a in (0, 1, 2) for b in (0, 1, 2)] for x in (0, 3, 6) for y in (0, 3, 6)]
    return not filter(lambda x: set(x) != set(range(1, 10)), board + zip(*board) + blocks)
```


## My Solution

```
def validSolution(board):
    vertical = [0] * 9
    sub_grid = {}

    for index, i in enumerate(board):
        if not all(i) or sum(i) != 45: # col 체크 
            return False

        for v_index, j in enumerate(i):
            # row 체크를 위해 vertical 리스트 생성하여 각 row 의 sum을 저장한다. 
            vertical[v_index] += j 
            
            # sub_grid 체크 행과열을 각각 3으로 나눠 나온 몫을 키 값으로 딕셔너리에 저장 
            key = "%d,%d" % (index/3, v_index/3)
            sub_grid[key] = sub_grid[key] + j if key in sub_grid else j

    if filter(lambda x: x != 45, vertical):
        return False

    if filter(lambda x: sub_grid[x] != 45 , sub_grid):
        return False

    return True
```
